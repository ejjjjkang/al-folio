**Hi, my name is Eun-Jeong (Alicia) ðŸ™‚**

(you can pronounce my name **"oong-jeong"**),

My research is related to build and design communication systems to improve online space creatively, positively, and collaboratively. Specifically, I am answering questions related to how AI can be designed to mediate humans'
communication by using human-centered approach.<br>
 Recently, I has been exploring problems of AI applications impacting real-world users such as fans, creators, and others.
<br>
 Before starting the academic life, I worked as a digital advertising content planner for about 3 years and also have work experience for a freelanced web developer.
 <br>
I am a first year PhD student @ Cornell University.</p>
You can confirm my CV @ [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qHcXlC2tz-_s7MbvZIfg-cwp5LtR9dXpFsYHLS_Tc6Q/edit){:target="\_blank"}. I hope to talk with you with any topics!
