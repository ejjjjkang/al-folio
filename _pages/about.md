**Hi, my name is Eunjeong ðŸ™‚**

(you can pronounce my name **"oong-jeong"**),

My research interest is related to build and design system to improve online space creatively, positively, and collaboratively. I am exploring the latest online social movements of public and their creative behaviors arising from communication such as creating memes, being passionated as a fan of someone. With the mediation of application supported by AI and data driven approaches, I believe that individuals, the member of the public is able to give off their potential beyond their own ability.

Eunjeong received **Master of Arts and Science degree** from the Department of Art and Technology at Sogang University in Korea.

Before starting the academic life, I worked as a digital advertising content planner for about 3 years. I majored in Advertising and Public Relations, but I took additional college courses for computer science and math, which is required for multidisciplinary study.
