Hi, my name is Eun,

My research interest is related to build and design system to improve online space creatively, positively, and collaboratively. I am exploring the latest online public social movements and improvements arising from their integration such as online discourse, memes, livestream, wikipedia. With the help of application supported by the AI and data driven approaches, I believe that personal, or the member of the public can give off their potentials.

I am a ph.D applicant for the Fall 2022 cycle!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
