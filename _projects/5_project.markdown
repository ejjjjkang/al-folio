In Korea, followed by the K-pop trend, playing dance becomes the one of the entertainment activities for generation Z (Gen Z). People would like to record their short dance videos and upload to YouTube, Tiktok and Instagram so that dance becomes some words which enable younger generation to understand each other.

Most of them usually utilize YouTube and Tiktok to learn their dance, however it is not easy for them to learn movements according to the idols or dancers actions. In this project, we support the novice dancers who don't get used to learn how to dance. We proceeded formative interviews with the students who were interested in dance, and YouTube creators.

This project is being supported by the <strong>Korea Contents Creative Agency</strong>. We will build prototype until November 2021 and publish it with web application.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
	<div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
		<img
			class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
			src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}"
			alt=""
			title="example image"
		/>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
		<img
			class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
			src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}"
			alt=""
			title="example image"
		/>
	</div>
</div>
