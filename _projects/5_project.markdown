<strong>Background</strong><br>
In South Korea, followed by the K-pop trend, K-Pop dance practices become popular between dancers as well as students. YouTube plays an important source that young people can learn dances. Furthermore, dancers gain inspirations from YouTube to be inspired for their dance creation. Based on the interviews with dancers, we found that they wantche YouTube parallelly, rather than watch videos in a row to compare detailed actions in the videos. <br>

To support their viewership, we devleoped a web-based video creative board named `Partti'. In the board, dancers as well as common users are able to watch videos parallelly and compare with the videos by creating their own playlists. In the board, users are able to collect videos to create playlists, then parallelize them together in our video player.

This project is supported by the <strong>Korea Contents Creative Agency fellowship</strong>. The prototype was built and deployed after several expert's feedback.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
	<div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
		<img
			class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
			src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}"
			alt=""
			title="example image"
		/>
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
		<img
			class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
			src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}"
			alt=""
			title="example image"
		/>
	</div>
</div>
``` -->
