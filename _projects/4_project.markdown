<strong>0️⃣ My role in the project</strong><br>

<strong>1️⃣ Overview</strong><br>
Fandom is a commonplace participatory experience which we can observe in everywhere from Star Wars to politicians' campaign.[1] The representation of the fandoms has shifted as the development of technology and trends.[2] In South Korea, a lot of fandom communities have emerged and grown their abilities at a great scale.

Specifically, our team focuses on the one fandom phenomenon.<br>
The fandoms like to promote the k-pop singers in person during the influencers' special occasions (ex: birthday, album releases date … ) at the public billboards or cafes.

In this project, we introduced 'Wall-dol',AR social billboard app. The fans able to interact with fans as well as their idols by remaining AR notes in the app. Through the dynamic interactions built in the app, the fans are able to feel social bonds with other fans, and even they can accumulate their own memories on the spot.
