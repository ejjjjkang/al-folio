This is a research project I worked at 'AI College'-community program from MODU Labs in Korea. As a researcher, I was involved in the project, and worked with developers and an art producer. For more than 6 month, we have been deeply immersed in the multiple algorithmic creation processes.

As one of our results, we presented 'when emotions become form', Artwork displaying a projection of human emotions into the images drawn by AI. The images generated by 'Pix2Pix' algorithms reflected multiple emotions classified by humans.
